# Hirely — Secure Technical Interview Platform (Prototype)

Hirely is a prototype for a simple idea: technical interviews should be fair, secure, and consistent, but today’s remote setups make that almost impossible. Interviews are easy to cheat on, hardware varies wildly, and the environment affects performance more than people admit.

Hirely keeps the interview exactly the same, but moves the candidate into a secure, proctored testing center.

Candidates check in, sit at a monitored workstation, and take their live technical interview - coding, system design, behavioral — on reliable equipment and in a distraction-free room. The interviewer connects remotely or sits on-site. Nothing about the interview changes except the environment.

This project is the backend foundation for Hirely: handling slots, reservations, check-ins, and interview status using a simple Express-based API + MongoDB (with plans to expand into a complete MERN stack).

Goal: make technical interviews fair, secure, and consistent — without forcing companies to change how they already interview.
